# Sudoku

A sudoku solver I made for fun! Uses some Boost libraries so make sure those are installed appropriately.

## Build and Run
'make' builds two executables in the build directory, solver and generator.<br><br> To run the generator use <br>
./generator [difficulty] output_file <br>
where difficulty is either 'easy', 'medium', or 'hard'. <br><br> To run the solver use <br>
./solver board_file
